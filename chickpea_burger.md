# Chickpea Burger

## Ingredients
- 425 grams chickpeas (rinsed and drained)
- 113 grams diced green chiles
- 40 grams flat leaf parsley leaves (packed)
- 72 grams bread crumbs
- salt
- pepper
- 1 large egg (lightly beaten)
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 4 slices cheddar cheese
- 4 hamburger buns

## Directions
In a food processor, pulse the chickpeas, green chiles and parsley until finely chopped. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and stir in the bread crumbs and salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the egg and form the mixture into 4 patties, each about 2 centimetre thick.

In a large skillet or grill pan, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Cook the burgers for 4 minutes, then flip and cook for 3 minutes more. Top the patties with the cheese slices for the last minute of cooking. Serve the cheeseburgers on the hamburger buns with mustard, ketchup or mayonnaise.
