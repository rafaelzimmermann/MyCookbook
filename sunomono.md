# Japanese cucumber sunomono (vinegared salad)

**Ingredients (2–3 servings):**

* 2 Japanese cucumbers (or 1 large English cucumber)
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp sesame seeds (toasted)
* Optional: wakame seaweed (rehydrated), imitation crab or shrimp

**Instructions:**

1. **Slice cucumber** very thin (use a mandoline if you have).
2. Sprinkle with **salt**, mix, and let sit 5–10 minutes. This draws out excess water.
3. Rinse lightly and squeeze to remove water.
4. In a small bowl, mix the **dressing**: rice vinegar, sugar, and soy sauce until sugar dissolves.
5. Add cucumbers (and optional wakame or seafood). Toss well.
6. Chill for at least 10 minutes.
7. Sprinkle with **toasted sesame seeds** before serving.
