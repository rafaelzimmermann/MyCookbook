# Sushi Rice

**Ingredients (makes about 4 rolls / 3–4 servings):**

* 2 cups sushi rice (short-grain Japanese rice)
* 2 cups water (plus extra for rinsing)

**Seasoning mix (awasezu):**

* ¼ cup rice vinegar
* ¼ cup sugar
* ¼ cup sake (or mirin, for more sweetness)
* 1 tsp salt (optional, but traditional)

**Steps:**

1. **Rinse the rice**

   * Place the rice in a large bowl, cover with cold water, and gently wash by moving your hand in circular motions.
   * Drain and repeat 3–4 times until the water runs almost clear.
   * Let the rice drain in a fine-mesh strainer for about 30 minutes.

2. **Cook the rice**

   * Combine the rinsed rice and 2 cups of water in a rice cooker (or a heavy pot with a lid).
   * If cooking in a pot: bring to a boil over medium heat, cover, then reduce to low and cook for 15 minutes.
   * Turn off the heat and let it steam (covered) for another 10 minutes. Do not lift the lid.

3. **Make the seasoning mix**

   * In a small saucepan, combine rice vinegar, sugar, sake (or mirin), and salt.
   * Heat gently until sugar dissolves (do not boil). Remove from heat and let cool slightly.

4. **Season the rice**

   * Transfer the hot rice to a large wooden, glass, or plastic bowl (avoid metal).
   * Pour the vinegar mixture evenly over the rice.
   * Using a wooden spatula, gently “slice” and fold the rice (do not stir vigorously) while fanning to help it cool.
   * Keep folding until the rice is glossy and slightly sticky, but the grains remain separate.

5. **Rest**

   * Cover the rice with a damp towel to prevent drying. Use it within 1–2 hours.
